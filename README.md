## Ah_Roon's Half-Life 2 Modpack Remastered ##
This modpack was created to improve the Half-Life 2, while keeping the original feel.

Unlike Amalgam Zenith or Half-Life 2 Redux, we focus on originality.

Please note that we respect the creator's copyright, so modpack won't be provided.

You will need to make modpack yourself by downloading their mod.

We recommended using MMod since this modpack's purpose is to be used with MMod.
