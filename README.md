## Ah_Roon's Half-Life 2 Modpack Remastered ##
This modpack was created to improve the Half-Life 2, while keeping the original feel.

Unlike Amalgam Zenith or Half-Life 2 Redux, we focus on originality.

Please note that we respect the creator's copyright, so modpack will not be distributed.

That means you'll need to compile yourself.

We recommended using MMod since this modpack's purpose is to be used with MMod. (You can exclude MMod if you mainly play HL2 based mods)

##Other thing##
This modpack will be used on my HL2 MMOD Gameplay video in the future!

Due to some mod maker's personality controversy, I decided to not include some of their mods on the list. 
I'm afraid I can't tell you who exactly they are. Thank you for understanding!
